DataEvaluationComparer
======================

Comparing speed of Esper and PostgreSQL data processing

To get some measured values of speed, I used offline mode combinated with 2 different queries. The first is about dictionary attack and the second is statistics of usage of server. In final stage, the output will be a table with 4 measured values, two queries and two architectures.

Currently, only Esper is working. The two others will be implemented soon.
